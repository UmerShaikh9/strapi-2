The collection is therefore rich with history and diversity. \n\nLehenga Material: Raw silk \nWeaving technique: Jangla\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Silvery Gold\nSkirt circumference: 4.5 meters\nWaist: Customizable from 24”-42”\nLength: Standard 42” customizable from 38”-44”\nColour: Dark Peach\n\nBlouse piece: One meter (unstitched)\nMaterial: Raw Silk \nWeaving technique: Peach Brocade\nHandwoven: Yes\n\nDupatta: Gold Crushed Tissue Silk 2.5 meters length, 1.1 meters Width\nHandwoven: Yes\n\nThe model bearing height of 5’2” wears waist size 26” and length 42”. \n\nNote: Every handwoven piece of fabric differs marginally from another. Minor disparities in colour and dimension  are a welcome part of the handwoven, hand-dyed industry - you would end up possessing a truly unique piece each time you invest in a handmade piece.

In the Tara-Tarini series, we bring you softest handwoven Katan silk dupattas with booti motifs. \n\nMaterial: Mulberry Silk \nWeaving technique: Kadhwa, Meenakari\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Gold \nMeenakari: Multicoloured\nlength: 2.5 meters (approximately)\nWidth: 1.1 meter (approximately)\nColour: Pink Peach Bud\n\nNote: No two handwoven pieces are alike in length, width, weave and colour. Minor disparities during the handweaving process makes it difficult for weavers to provide exact replicas in case of pre-order. \n \nSKU: TATAS000125/MSPK\n",

    "description": "The Kanaklata Collection brings together two abiding crafts from two ancient craft centres: the delicate and diaphanous mulberry Kora Silk Tissue weave from Banaras and the ornate Zardozi embroidery from Persia. \n\nThe long slit, straight cut tunic (also known as kurta/kurti/kameez) in this three-piece set is paired with loose-fitting pants (known as pants/palazzo/shalwar) and a long scarf (known as dupatta/odhna/chunni). The tunic is lined with pure cotton. \n\nThe Kora Tissue fabric used in this collection is fluid with excellent sheen and drape. It uses Zari in the weft that lends it metallic lustre and can be worn in summers as well as in winters. The fabric is hard to weave and sew. It requires tender handling and care through its life cycle. For this reason, the pants have been lined with pure Mashru Satin silk. The lining not only strengthens the delicate fabric but also lends extra softness, lustre and character to the outfit. \n\nMaterial: Kora Silk Tissue and Mashru satin\nWeaving technique: Plain weave using silk in warp and zari in weft\nZari colour: Gold \nFabric Colour: Dual tone Grey and German Blue\nTunic length: 44 inches standard.

Can be custom tailored.  \nDupatta Length and width: 2.5 meters x 1.1 meter\nStitching time for custom-made requests: 10-14 working days from the date of order\n\nNote: No two handwoven pieces are alike in length, width, weave and colour.

    "description": "The Kanaklata Collection brings together two abiding crafts from two ancient craft centres: the delicate and diaphanous mulberry Kora Silk Tissue weave from Banaras and the ornate Zardozi embroidery from Persia. \n\nThe long slit, straight cut tunic (also known as kurta/kurti/kameez) in this three-piece set is paired with loose-fitting pants (known as pants/palazzo/shalwar) and a long scarf (known as dupatta/odhna/chunni). The tunic is lined with pure cotton. \n\nThe Kora Tissue fabric used in this collection is fluid with excellent sheen and drape. It uses Zari in the weft that lends it metallic lustre and can be worn in summers as well as in winters. The fabric is hard to weave and sew. It requires tender handling and care through its life cycle. For this reason, the pants have been lined with pure Mashru Satin silk. The lining not only strengthens the delicate fabric but also lends extra softness, lustre and character to the outfit. \n\nMaterial: Kora Silk Tissue and Mashru satin\nWeaving technique: Plain weave using silk in warp and zari in weft\nZari colour: Gold \nFabric Colour: Dual Maroon and Royal Blue\nTunic length: 44 inches standard. Can be custom tailored.  \nPant length: 35 Inches standard. Can be custom tailored.  \nDupatta Length and width: 2.5 meters x 1.1 meter\n\n\nWe stock a limited number of pieces in medium size. For other sizes or custom fits, please call us to discuss and preorder. \nStitching time for custom requests: 10-14 working days from the date of order. \n\nNote: No two handwoven pieces are alike in length, width, weave and colour. Minor disparities during the handweaving process makes it difficult for weavers to provide exact replicas in case of pre-order. \n \n\n\nSKU: KANK000325/SVMP\n\n",

In these stylish sets, the one-size fits all tunic uses the rare and highly prized Muga silk of Assam with Vintage Banarasi borders dating 80-100 years. \n\nThe Muga silk’s long silk filaments are neither easy to source nor easy to treat and weave; very few skilled artisans in Banaras are able to honour its glory. The skeins require long months of processing to degum and soften till they become super soft and almost cotton-like in look and feel. They also have a laborious dyeing process as the fabric takes up colour differently from the widely used Mulberry Silk. \n\nThe Muga Kaftan top with Banarasi Booti motif in this two-piece set is paired with wide legged pants in pure Mulberry Chiniya silk.

    "description": "The Zephyr Kaftan sets are a collectible. In these stylish sets, the one-size fits all tunic uses the rare and highly prized Muga silk of Assam with Vintage Banarasi borders dating 80-100 years. \n\nThe Muga silk’s long silk filaments are neither easy to source nor easy to treat and weave; very few skilled artisans in Banaras are able to honour its glory. The skeins require long months of processing to degum and soften till they become super soft and almost cotton-like in look and feel. They also have a laborious dyeing process as the fabric takes up colour differently from the widely used Mulberry Silk. \n\nThe Muga Kaftan top with Banarasi Booti motif in this two-piece set is paired with wide legged pants in pure Mulberry Chiniya silk.  Both the silk fabrics are extremely soft with excellent drape. \n\nMaterials: Pure Muga Silk and Mulberry Chiniya Silk\nWeaving techniques: Kadhwa\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Gold \nFabric Colour: Yellow\nKaftan length: 45 inches standard. Chest fits upto 46 inches. Can be custom expanded upto 50 inches. \nPant length: 36 Inches standard. Can be custom tailored upto 45 inches length. Hips fit 46 inches. Can be custom expanded upto 60 inches wide. \nStitching time for custom requests: 10-14 working days from the date of order. \n\nNote: Each of these pieces is unique. While the base Muga silk colour can be replicated, the vintage borders are non-replicable. The booti pattern may also differ in the next edition. \n\nSKU: ZYPR0000325/DANP",

    "description": "The Zephyr Kaftan sets are a collectible. In these stylish sets, the one-size fits all tunic uses the rare and highly prized Muga silk of Assam with Vintage Banarasi borders dating 80-100 years. \n\nThe Muga silk’s long silk filaments are neither easy to source nor easy to treat and weave; very few skilled artisans in Banaras are able to honour its glory. The skeins require long months of processing to degum and soften till they become super soft and almost cotton-like in look and feel. They also have a laborious dyeing process as the fabric takes up colour differently from the widely used Mulberry Silk. \n\nThe Muga Kaftan top with Banarasi Booti motif in this two-piece set is paired with wide legged pants in pure Mulberry Chiniya silk.  Both the silk fabrics are extremely soft with excellent drape. \n\nMaterials: Pure Muga Silk and Mulberry Chiniya Silk\nWeaving techniques: Kadhwa\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Gold \nFabric Colour: Red\nKaftan length: 45 inches standard. Chest fits upto 46 inches. Can be custom expanded upto 50 inches. \nPant length: 36 Inches standard. Can be custom tailored upto 45 inches length. Hips fit 46 inches. Can be custom expanded upto 60 inches wide. \nStitching time for custom requests: 10-14 working days from the date of order. \n\nNote: Each of these pieces is unique. While the base Muga silk colour can be replicated, the vintage borders are non-replicable. The booti pattern may also differ in the next edition. \n\nSKU: ZYPR0000425/DANP\n",

    "description": "The Zephyr Kaftan sets are a collectible. In these stylish sets, the one-size fits all tunic uses the rare and highly prized Muga silk of Assam with Vintage Banarasi borders dating 80-100 years.\n\nThe Muga silk’s long silk filaments are neither easy to source nor easy to treat and weave; very few skilled artisans in Banaras are able to honour its glory. The skeins require long months of processing to degum and soften till they become super soft and almost cotton-like in look and feel. They also have a laborious dyeing process as the fabric takes up colour differently from the widely used Mulberry Silk.\n\nThe Muga Kaftan top with Banarasi Booti motif in this two-piece set is paired with wide legged pants in pure Mulberry Chiniya silk. Both the silk fabrics are extremely soft with excellent drape.\n\nMaterials: Pure Muga Silk and Mulberry Chiniya Silk\nWeaving techniques: Kadhwa\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Gold\nFabric Colour: Royal Blue\nKaftan length: 45 inches standard.

In these stylish sets, the one-size fits all tunic uses the rare and highly prized Muga silk of Assam with Vintage Banarasi borders dating 80-100 years. \n\nThe Muga silk’s long silk filaments are neither easy to source nor easy to treat and weave; very few skilled artisans in Banaras are able to honour its glory. The skeins require long months of processing to degum and soften till they become super soft and almost cotton-like in look and feel. They also have a laborious dyeing process as the fabric takes up colour differently from the widely used Mulberry Silk. \n\nThe Muga Kaftan top with Banarasi Booti motif in this two-piece set is paired with wide legged pants in pure Mulberry Chiniya silk.  Both the silk fabrics are extremely soft with excellent drape. \n\nMaterials: Pure Muga Silk and Mulberry Chiniya Silk\nWeaving techniques: Kadhwa\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Gold \nFabric Colour: Yellow\nKaftan length: 45 inches standard. Chest fits upto 46 inches. Can be custom expanded upto 50 inches. \nPant length: 36 Inches standard. Can be custom tailored upto 45 inches length. Hips fit 46 inches.

Gulaal, a Hindi word, refers to coloured powders (earlier made from plant derivatives) that were a joyful part of the Spring festival of Holi. Holi celebrates burst of colours: flowers are rampant, birds are returning home, singing, mating; people are shedding dark winter-wear and everything is blooming. \n\nThe Rangkat weaves typically use silk and zari in 5-14 colours. The rare Kadhiyal weaving technique is used to create fused patterns that are bold and often geometric. Zari is used to fuse each colour motif in either Kadhwa or Cutwork technique. \n\nMaterial: Katan silk \nWeaving technique:  Kadhiyal Rangkat Motif\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Golden \nSkirt circumference: 5 meters\nWaist: Customizable from 24”-42”\nLength: Standard 42” customizable from 38”-44”\nColour: Base Sunset-Orange,  Multicolour pattern\n\nBlouse piece: One meter (unstitched)\nMaterial: Katan Silk \nWeaving technique: Katan Silk Brocade\nHandwoven: Yes\n\nDupattas: Orange-Pink and/or Green booti (optional), 2.5 meters length, 1.1 meters Width\nMaterials: Tissue silk and Katan Silk\nWeaving technique: Booti \nHandwoven: Yes\n\nThe model bearing height of 5’7” wears waist size 26” and length 42”. \n\nNo of pieces available: 0\n\nNote: Every handwoven piece of fabric differs marginally from another.

    "description": "Our Soie Collection Satin weaves utilize a special technique: five weft threads of pure mulberry silk are woven over a single warp thread using a heald shaft (locally known as 'kaadi'). Both the warp and weft threads are six-ply. This denser weave, using more than double the amount of pure mulberry silk, results in a heavier, creamier, and richer texture.\n\nCommonly called Mashru Satin as they use the weaving technique of Mashru Silks. However, True Mashru silk uses silk warp and cotton weft to respect religious injunctions – it is an Arabic word meaning ‘permitted or allowed’. \n\nMaterial: Satin silk, Six ply \nWeaving technique:  Kadhwa, Booti \nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Golden \nMeenakari: \nSkirt circumference: 5 meters\nWaist: Customizable from 24”-42”\nLength: Standard 42” customizable from 38”-44”\nColour: Hot Pink\n\nBlouse piece: One meter (unstitched)\nMaterial: Satin Silk \nWeaving technique: Kadhwa\nHandwoven: Yes\n\nDupatta: Pink booti (optional), 2.5 meters length, 1.1 meters Width\nMaterial: Tissue silk \nWeaving technique: Booti \nHandwoven: Yes\n\nThe model of height of 5’2” wears waist size 26” and length 42”. \n\n\nSKU: LEH-SOIE/00001/25/TJBP\n",

    "description": "This three piece Lucknawi style Gharara set from our Bahu-Begum collection consists of  knee length brocade top, a pair of wide-legged bottom in silk tissue and a dupatta. The special hand-brushed silk tissue dyeing technique used in the bottom helps create multicoloured stripes. Two colours of blue dupatta have been paired to give an option. Either one may be chosen. \n\nTypically, traditional gharara pants use between 6-12 meters of fabric to make a loose kunda (from waist till thigh) and very loose got (knee to floor). The kunda and got are joined by banat using the ruching technique. Banat is embellished with embroidery or borders. In this set, 6 meters of fabric has been used to create the bottom. Zari embroidered borders have been used over the banat area. We are grateful to the master craftsmen who have taught us how to sew this classic cut. \n\nFor contemporary, tight fitting bottoms, please contact our team on the numbers listed on our website. \n\nMaterial: Tissue silk, katan silk\nWeaving technique: Plain tissue with hand-brush dyeing, brocading\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Golden\nKurta length: 34” standard customizable upto 39”\nGharara length: 42” standard customizable from 38”-44”\nColour: Ice Blue\nStitching time for orders placed for standard and custom size: 14 days\n\nSKU: GHAR/0005/25/DANP\n",

    "description": "Charulata is a Sanskrit word that means ‘a beautiful climber’. This collection brings you handwoven vine motifs laden with flowers (jangla motifs). Most of the Vine designs are classics and depict how the weavers and ‘naqshabands’ have been inspired by nature. Travellers over centuries have added floral patterns to the Banarasi repertoire - they have brought the motifs of plants that do not grow in the Ganges plain region. The collection is therefore rich with history and diversity. \n\nThe embroidery across the Lehenga and dupatta is Zardozi. Both the dupattas in the pictures are optional - One is in tissue silk with Zardozi edges and the other is a kadwa booti katan silk dupatta. \n\nMaterial: Katan silk \nWeaving technique:  Jangla, Meenakari  Tilfi\nHandwoven: Yes\nZari colour: Golden and silver\nMeenakari: Multicolour\nSkirt circumference: 5 meters\nWaist: Customizable from 24”-42”\nLength: Standard 42” customizable from 38”-44”\nColour: Hot Pink\nColour options available: NA\nStitching time: 14 working days\n\nBlouse piece: One meter (unstitched)\nMaterial: Katan Silk \nWeaving technique: Katan Silk Brocade\nHandwoven: Yes\n\nDupattas: Pink booti (optional), 2.5 meters length, 1.1 meters Width\nMaterials: Tissue silk and Katan Silk\nWeaving technique: Booti \nHandwoven: Yes\n\nThe model bearing height of 5’2” wears waist size 26” and length 42”. \n\nNo of pieces available: 0\n\nNote: Every handwoven piece of fabric differs marginally from another. Minor disparities in colour and dimension  are a welcome part of the handwoven, hand-dyed industry - you would end up possessing a truly unique piece each time you invest in a handmade piece. You are playing an important role in keeping the handicraft industry and the Banarasi art alive. \n\nSKU: LEH-CHAR/00002/25/PKAD\n",

    "description": "This saree is from our soft and flowy Kora Silk Tissue Jhilmil Collection.\n\nTissue fabric uses silk across the warp. The weft is woven using zari thread. (Gold, silver, or other metals are wrapped around natural filaments to make zari yarn). The gossamer fabric that emerges from such a technique shimmers and gleams.
